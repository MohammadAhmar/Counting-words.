# Counting-words.
// In this project you will complete a word counting program.  // Your task is to write a complete implementation for the // class Z00000000 which is used to count generic Objects.  The type X is a // key for looking up objects and the type Y is the type of Objects to be entered.  // In our application, X is used as a String and represents the lower case version // of a word (with any final letter s removed). // In our application, Y is also used as a String and represents the word as found.  // The main method which tests your class uses it to construct a Counter object. // The Utility run method operates with your Counter object. The method reads a file called // text.txt (or a user specified file if this does not exist) and reports a count of words  // in it. Two words are considered the same if their only difference is capitalization or // a final letter s on the end.  The report lists all words that appear at least 10 times // together with a count for the word and a list of all versions of the word that were found. // A typical line of the report might read: //    // end:   total count 61, end, END, Ends, ends, End // // This means that end was found 61 times and appeared in 5 different forms as //   end, END, Ends, ends and End.  //  You must complete an implementation for the //  class Z00000000 which is used to count generic Objects.
